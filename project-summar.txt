The project now provides a complete, production-ready DevOps playground that demonstrates modern best practices for:
Infrastructure as Code (Terraform)
Container Orchestration (Kubernetes/EKS)
GitOps (ArgoCD)
Monitoring (Prometheus/Grafana)
Security (Trivy, CIS compliance)
CI/CD (GitHub Actions)
This is a comprehensive foundation that can be used for learning, experimentation, or as a starting point for real-world projects!
